# Prediction of genomic regions participating in the formation of transcriptional condensates

This repository contains scripts related to the 3 main steps of a computational pipeline that aims to propose genomic regions that participate in the formation of transcriptional condensates. 

The pipeline can be broken down into 3 stages: 

1. **Segmentation of the genome**
2. **Annotation of segments**
3. **Integration of Hi-C data**

The scripts that perform the above tasks are written in R. In some cases computation was carried out in a computer cluster that uses the Univa GRID engine as batch system. In those cases, an accompanied script is also provided.
